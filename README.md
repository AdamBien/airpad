Collaborative Note Taking App

airpad was written for [airhacks attendees](http://airhacks.com) for quick notes
and link sharing.

Launch an airpad:

1. `mvn clean install` (native installer is created after the application's launch)
2. Create a note by typing a title and hitting enter.
3. Write the body of the note below
4. Search for, or create, more notes by typing in the upper bar.
5. "Enjoy" the sync experience (it's not perfect yet) :-)
