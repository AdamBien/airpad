Collaborative Note Taking App

airpad was written for [airhacks attendees](http://airhacks.com) for quick notes
and link sharing.

Launch an airpad:

1. `mvn clean install` (native installer is created after the application's launch)
2. Launch another one...
3. "Enjoy" (is not perfect yet) the sync experience :-)
